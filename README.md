- 👋 Hi there, I'm Jun. You can call me Neo, still not sure if I'm the one. 
- 👀 I’m interested in building web applications and learning programming language in general. 
- :muscle: I'm currently working on a [github-search-user](https://github.com/hwangs12/starter-project-react-github-search-users) react app
- 🌱 Basically, I am trying to build everything on the web and understand all of its processes. 
- 💞️ What I learned is that web development is not one language fits all but every small little parts partially/wholly connected to other parts. 
- :lemon: 2022 Goal: Contribute to open source projects!
- 📫 Please contact me via email sungjun94@gmail.com
